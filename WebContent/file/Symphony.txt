Symphony
Clean Bandit
Ive been hearing symphonies
Before all i heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo singing on my own
Now I cant find the key without you
And now your song is on repeat
And Im dancin on to your heartbeat
And when youre gone I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your sympony
Will you hold me tight and not let go
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go
Im sorry if its all too much
Every day youre here Im healing
And I was runnin out of luck
I never thought Id find this feeling
Cause Ive been hearing symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
And now your song is on repeat
And Im dancin on to your heartbeat
And when youre gone I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
And now your song is on repeat
And Im dancin on to your heartbeat
And when youre gone I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
Oh oh oh
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go
